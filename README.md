# Lab3GameAI
This lab simulates a basic city environment with both cars and pedestrians. The simulation includes traffic lights that control the flow of both vehicle and pedestrian traffic. There are three types of agents within the simulation: Panic and Defensive cars, and Pedestrians.



Agents:
Pedestrians:
  - React to pedestrian lights
Cars (2 different agents: Panic and Defensive):
  - Panic:
    - May Red Lights and may crash into other cars
    - May be faster than regular cars
   - Defensive (Regular)
    - Follow street rules
    - Have random speeds
    
Systems:
  - Traffic Ligths:
    - Affects behaviors of cars and pedestrian lights
  - Pedestrian Lights:
    - Affects pedestrian behaviors 
  - Checkpoints:
    - Changes destination and manages the index of traffic lights that affect cars and pedestrians.
